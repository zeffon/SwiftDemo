// Handler class

// and provide a set of values which will be used to complete the template.
class UNCHandler: PageHandler { // all template handlers must inherit from PageHandler
	
	// This is the function which all handlers must impliment.
	// It is called by the system to allow the handler to return the set of values which will be used when populating the template.
	// - parameter context: The MustacheEvaluationContext which provides access to the WebRequest containing all the information pertaining to the request
	// - parameter collector: The MustacheEvaluationOutputCollector which can be used to adjust the template output. For example a `defaultEncodingFunc` could be installed to change how outgoing values are encoded.
